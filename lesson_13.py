Session 16 Homework: Exception & pytest

Exception Handling:
- Write a Python function that takes two integer inputs from the user and calculates their
division. Handle the ZeroDivisionError and prompt the user to re-enter the second
number if it is zero.
- Use a custom exception called InvalidInputError to handle cases where the user
inputs non-integer values.
- Test your function with different inputs, including valid and invalid values, and ensure that
the exceptions are raised and handled correctly.

Pytest:
- Write a simple Python function that takes two numbers as inputs and returns their sum.
- Write a pytest function to test this function and verify that it returns the correct sum for
different input values.
